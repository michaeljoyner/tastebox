In terms of ingredients, mostly all you will need is salt, pepper and cooking oil. We sometimes require you to add some milk or perhaps a pinch of sugar.',

However, it has a low smoking point, meaning that when you use it on a high heat, the beneficial compounds begin to degrade. Rather use canola, avocado or coconut oil for high heat cooking.',
